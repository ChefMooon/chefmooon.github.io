Welcome, and thank you for stopping by! I’m excited to announce that the initial features of the ChefMooon's Hub website are complete.

Here, you’ll find the latest information for all of my mods: Breeze Bounce, Colourful Clocks, Fright's Delight, and Ube's Delight. Each mod’s page will be regularly updated to reflect the newest changes with every mod update.

My main goal is to make it easy for you to find detailed crafting recipes and essential mod information. Currently, the site features recipes for Minecraft 1.21.1, with support for other versions coming soon as I continue to expand.

Moving forward, this website will replace the GitHub Wikis for Ube's Delight and Fright's Delight, while basic wikis are also available for Breeze Bounce and Colourful Clocks.

Stay tuned for more updates, and thanks for being part of the community!
