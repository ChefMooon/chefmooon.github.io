### **Velcro Armour**
A set of armour crafted from leather and cactus that provides a unique "Velcro" effect when worn as a complete suit. While shifting, players can cling to and climb wool-like blocks with ease. Additionally, you can apply vanilla armour trims to personalize your gear.

**Details**
- Crafted from: Leather and Cactus
- Dyeable: Yes (similar to leather armour)
- Full Set Effect: Velcro
- Compatible with vanilla armour trims

**Velcro Effect Mechanics**
- Player must be sneaking (shifting)
- Only works on Breeze Bounce blocks
- Allows vertical climbing and surface clinging
- Works on all wool-like blocks
    - Breeze Bounce variants
    - Wool colours
- Movement while crouching on walls is dependent on the direction the player is moving and looking. Looking directly away from the wall will invert up/down direction
- When sticking to walls sometimes the velcro is extra sticky. Make sure to wiggle back and forth a bit to keep moving.

**Technical Details**
- Armor value and protection equivalent to leather armour
