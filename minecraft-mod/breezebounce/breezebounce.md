### **Velcro Armour**

Crafted from leather and cactus, this dyeable armour set provides a unique "Velcro" effect when worn as a complete suit. While shifting, you can cling to and climb wool-like blocks with ease. Additionally, you can apply vanilla armour trims to personalize your gear.

### **Bounce Blocks**

A set of Wind Charge-infused, wool-like blocks that will bounce entities that touch any side. When struck by a wind charge the block becomes 'Inflated' for a short duration, while inflated bounce power is increased. They are available as full blocks, stairs, slabs, and posts. 

**Double Bounce**  
If a sneaking player falls from a height of 2.8 blocks or more onto a non-inflated Bounce Block, the block along with any connected within a 1-block radius will become 'Inflated' for a short duration (4 seconds / 80 ticks). Entities on affected blocks bounce upward immediately.

### **Inflation Machine**

A functional block that keeps a group of connected Bounce Blocks ‘Inflated’ as long as it is fueled. Inflation can extend 5 blocks to the side and 1 block above/below in a 11x11x3 area. It can also be placed on its side allowing for greater vertical Inflation(3x11x11).
