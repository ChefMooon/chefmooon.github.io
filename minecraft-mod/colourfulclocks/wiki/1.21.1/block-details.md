### **Bornholm Grandfather Clock**

This is a multi-block decorative and functional structure that allow players to display time in a highly customizable, animated way. The Hour hand will be at the top (12) at noon and midnight. It will also make a ding sound if trunk has a Pendulum.

To function properly, it must be assembled vertically in this order:

**Base** – The bottom section that provides the structural foundation.

**Trunk** – The central body of the clock, housing the swinging pendulum.

**Dial** – The top section, containing the clock face and driving the actual time display.

**Customization Options**
- **Wood Type**: Oak, Spruce, Birch, Jungle, Acacia, Dark Oak, Mangrove, Cherry, Bamboo, Crimson, Warped, Stripped Oak, Stripped Spruce, Stripped Birch, Stripped Jungle, Stripped Acacia, Stripped Dark Oak, Stripped Mangrove, Stripped Cherry, Stripped Bamboo, Stripped Crimson, Stripped Warped

### Dial

The Dial is the top section of the Bornholm Grandfather Clock and serves as its functional core. When a Pocket Watch is inserted, the clock hands appear and begin rotating, displaying the current in-game time in an analog format.

- **Insert Pocket Watch**: Right-click the Dial with a Pocket Watch in hand.
- **Remove Pocket Watch**: Sneak (Shift) + Right-click with an empty hand.

**Customization Options**
- **Clock Hand**: The material of the inserted Pocket Watch determines the style of the clock hands. Available materials include:
Iron, Copper, Exposed Copper, Weathered Copper, Oxidized Copper, Gold, Diamond, Netherite, Quartz, Amethyst, Lapis Lazuli, Redstone, Emerald.
- **Glass Face**: right-click with a glass pane of any colour to change

### Trunk

The Trunk is the central section of the Bornholm Grandfather Clock. When a Pendulum is inserted into a functioning clock it will swing at a varied speed based on material.

- **Insert Pendulum**: Right-click the Dial with a Pocket Watch in hand.
- **Remove Pendulum**: Sneak (Shift) + Right-click with an empty hand.

**Customization Options**
- **Pendulum**: The material of the Pocket Watch defines the pendulum's appearance and swing speed. Available materials:
Iron, Copper, Exposed Copper, Weathered Copper, Oxidized Copper, Gold, Diamond, Netherite, Quartz, Amethyst, Lapis Lazuli, Redstone, Emerald

### Base

The Base is the bottom-most section of the Bornholm Grandfather Clock. It provides structural support for the Trunk and Dial, and while it has no mechanical function of its own, it is required to build a complete, working Grandfather Clock.

- **Function**: Provides stability and completes the multi-block structure.
- **Placement**: Must be placed below the Trunk and Dial.
