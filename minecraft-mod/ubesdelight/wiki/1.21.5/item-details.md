## Rolling Pin

The Rolling Pin is a new tool, primarily used to craft recipes on the Baking Mat.

### Crafting

Rolling Pins come in 5 tiers, each offering varying durability. They are crafted using 2 sticks and the material of your choice.

**Crafting Details:**
- Wooden Rolling Pin: Crafted using any type of fence as the material.
- Netherite Rolling Pin: Upgraded from a Diamond Rolling Pin using a Smithing Tetmplate and Netherite Ingot in a Smithing Table.
- Other Tiers: Crafted using their respective ingots (e.g., Iron, Gold, or Diamond).

**Durability**
- Wood Rolling Pin (131 Durability)[[recipe](/ubesdelight/wiki/1.21.1/recipes.html#minecraft:crafting_shaped/rolling_pin_wood)]
- Iron Rolling Pin (250 Durability)[[recipe](/ubesdelight/wiki/1.21.1/recipes.html#minecraft:crafting_shaped/rolling_pin_iron)]

### Usage

Rolling Pins are primarily used for crafting. However, if options are limited it can be used as a weapon. It does very little damage but has increased knockback. 

### Food Preparation

When combined with a Baking Mat, Rolling Pins allow players to combine up to 9 items with the chance of 1 or more outputs. 

### Enchanting

Rolling Pins are able to receive the following enchantments:

- Mending, Unbreaking III, Fortune III

Fortune only effects the chance output from recipes on the Baking Mat.

### Compatibility
