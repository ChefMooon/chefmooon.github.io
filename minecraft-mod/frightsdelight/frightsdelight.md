The concept behind this mod is to craft food and beverage items using materials obtained from hostile mobs, with each culinary creation aimed at achieving a balanced blend of elements, including horror, whimsy, and a Minecraft-inspired essence. 5 harmful Status Effects add minor inconveniences or non-intrusive psychological horror elements, while 2 beneficial Status Effects help by giving immunity to certain effects.
