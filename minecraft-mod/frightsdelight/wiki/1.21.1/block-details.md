## Soul Berry Bush

Soul Berry Bushes are rare plants that naturally spawn anywhere in the Nether, thriving on Soul Sand and Soul Soil, with the highest concentrations found in Soul Sand Valleys. The berries can also be found in Bastion chests scattered across the Nether. The bush can be planted on any block that provides soul speed(Soul Sand, Soul Soil). The Soul Berry Bush requires a source of “Soul Light”(Soul Fire, Soul Torch, Soul Lantern, Soul Campfire) within 5 blocks(1 Above/Below) and a light level of 9 or higher. Berries will shimmer if growing.

When using Bone Meal the light requirement is ignored, however a source of "Soul Light" is still required within 5 blocks.

## Wither Berry Bush

The Wither Berry Bush can only be created from a fully grown Soul Berry Bush. To Turn a Soul Berry Bush Into a Wither Berry bush you must place a source of “Wither Essence”(Wither Rose, Wither Skeleton Skull) within 1 block(1 Above/Below) and a light level of 7 or below.

The Wither Berry Bush requires a source of Wither Essence within 1 block and a light level of 7 or below.  Berries will smoke if growing.

When using Bone Meal the light requirement is ignored, however a source of "Wither Essence" is still required within 1 block.

## Punch Bowls

Punch Bowls are large versions of drinks you are able to place, providing multiple drink servings.

### Usage

- Rotten Flesh Punch Bowl
- Slime Apple Cider Bowl*
- Spider Eye Punch Bowl

The block must be placed to retrieve the servings. When placed, with a glass bottle in the main hand, players can use (right click) on the block to retrieve a serving. Servings can also be added back if there is space.

Each Punch Bowl provides 4 servings, when no servings are left the last drops of the contained liquid will remain. The block can be broken with a knife, servings will drop when broken.

*Gives off light. Light level is dependant on number of servings.

### Redstone

This block gives off a redstone signal that can be interpreted by a redstone comparator. The signal strength depends on the amount of servings in the block. 4 Servings = 8 Signal Strength.

A Dispenser can be used to add servings to a Punch Bowl.
