## Berry Bushes

The following bushes can grow in any dimension when light and block requirements are met. 

### Soul Berry Bush

Soul Berry Bushes are rare plants that naturally spawn anywhere in the Nether, thriving on Soul Sand and Soul Soil, with the highest concentrations found in Soul Sand Valleys. The berries can also be found in Bastion chests scattered across the Nether. The bush can be planted on any block that provides soul speed(Soul Sand, Soul Soil). The Soul Berry Bush requires a source of “Soul Light”(Soul Fire, Soul Torch, Soul Lantern, Soul Campfire) within 5 blocks(1 Above/Below) and a light level of 9 or higher. Berries will shimmer if growing.

When using Bone Meal the light requirement is ignored, however a source of "Soul Light" is still required within 5 blocks.

### Wither Berry Bush

The Wither Berry Bush can only be created from a fully grown Soul Berry Bush. To Turn a Soul Berry Bush Into a Wither Berry bush you must place a source of “Wither Essence”(Wither Rose, Wither Skeleton Skull) within 1 block(1 Above/Below) and a light level of 7 or below.

The Wither Berry Bush requires a source of Wither Essence within 1 block and a light level of 7 or below.  Berries will smoke if growing.

When using Bone Meal the light requirement is ignored, however a source of "Wither Essence" is still required within 1 block.

### Resurgent/Soul Soil Compatibility
